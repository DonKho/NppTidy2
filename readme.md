# HTML Tidy 2 Plugin for Notepad++ 

This is a quick and dirty plugin to add easy HTML tidying to Notepad++, given the few issues reported with the existing Tidy plugin.

This uses the excellent tidy-html5 from [http://github.com/w3c/tidy-html5][1]

The code desperately needs a tidy up, this is a few hours work just to solve the current problems.

## Installation

Just copy the Tidy2.dll to your Notepad++\plugins directory.  Ideally add the doc folder to Notepad++\plugins directory too, this will mean you have the correct
documentation, and the "Show Config Help" option will show the documentation that applies to your version (rather than simply the latest on the web)
